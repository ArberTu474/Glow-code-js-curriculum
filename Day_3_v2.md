## Topics
- Recap of the previous topics, variables, operators and conditions.
- Introduce the concept of loops: repeating blocks of code.
- Explain why we need loops: to avoid writing repetitive code manually.
- Introduce the `while` and `for` loop.
- Introduce the concept of `functions`.
- Show how loops adn functions can work together for better understanding of both concepts.

## Loops
### What is a loop
Loops let us `repeat a block of code ` multiple times without writing it again and again.
### Types of loops
- `while` loop
- `for` loop
### Syntax and example
## **__While Loop__**
The ```while``` loop is used when  **__you don't know in advance__** how many times you want to repeat something: you just know you want to keep going **__while__** a condition is true.
- We clarify that everything that goes inside the while loop will be executed as many times as the condition remains true 
- The example below will repeat as long as the condition `count<0` is true.
- Tell them to be careful to increase the value of the variable count otherwise the loop will run forever.

``` js
let count = 0;
while (count<5){
    displayLn("Count is: ", count);
    count++;
}
```
- First the condition is checked: `count<5`
- If it is true, the block of code runs
- After running, it checks again, and continues until the condition is false
  
### Exercise 1
Write a program that print odd numbers from 1 to 20 using a `while` loop
### Solution
```js
let number = 1;
while (number<=20){
  displayln(number)
  number+=2
}
```
## **__For loop__**
A ```for``` loop is used when **__you know exactly how many times__** you want to repeat something.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  displayLn("i is: ", i);
}
```
- Explain that we need a variable let i = 0: as a start value
- i < 5: Condition to continue looping as long as we need, in this case it runs as long as i is less than 5
- i++: Increase i by 1 after every loop to make sure that our loop will stop at some point and not run forever.
This loop will run 5 times: when i is 0,1,2,3, and 4

## Why we use loops?
- Imagine we have to print numbers from 1 to 10 or maybe 1-100, we don't wnat to use displayln() for each  number that would be a waste of time.
- Now that we know how loops work we could use loops to do that automatically.

```js
for(let i =0; i<10;i++){
    displayln(i)
}
```
### Exercise 1
Write a program that prints all even numbers from 2 to 20 using a `for` loop.
We can use `console` to do these examples and exercises
### Solution
```js
for (let i =5;i<=20;i+=2){
    displayln(i)
}
```
### Exercise 2
Write a program that prints numbers from 15 to 1 using a `for` loop.
We use this exercise to make clear:
- that we can start with a value different from 0.
- the condition is also different we have to check if i is greater than the number used to repeat the loop
- the last part of the loop will now be a decrement of the value of i by one not increment
- let the students try and solve the exercise, if they have difficulty in figuring out we can help them

### Solution
```js
for(let i = 15; i>0;i--){
  displayln(i)
}
```
## Functions in JavaScript

### What is a Function?

A `function` is a block of code that performs a task and can be used `multiple times`.
All programming languages come with a bunch of built-in ready to use functions, but we can also build our own functions.

**__Analogy__**

- Think of a function like a vending machine:

- You press a button (call the function).

- It gives you the same snack (output) every time!

**__Syntax of a Function__**
``` js
function greet() {
  displayLn("Hello!");
}

greet(); // Calls the function

```
**__`function greet() {`__**

- `function`: This keyword is used to declare a function.

- `greet`: This is the name of the function. You can choose other names depending on what the function does.

- `()`: Parentheses hold the parameters (input values). This function doesnâ€™t need any.

- `{}`: Curly braces wrap around the block of code that runs when the function is called.

**__`displayLn("Hello!");`__**
- This is the task the function performs. It calls the displayLn function to print "Hello!".

**__`}`__**
- Marks the end of the function.

**__`greet();`__**
- This line **__calls__** or **__executes__** the function, so it runs the code inside.

###  Function with Parameters
#### What Are Parameters?
Parameters allow you to make a function more flexible. Think of them as **placeholders** for the information you want to pass into the function.

When you define a function, you can include parameters inside the parentheses `()`.
When you call the function, you provide **arguments**, which are the actual values passed to the function.

This way, the same function can do slightly different things depending on the input.
```js
function greetUser(name) {
  displayLn("Hello, ", name);
}

greetUser("Lori");
greetUser("Elsa");
```

- `function`: Declares a new function.

- `greetUser`: Name of the function. It's descriptive and tells us it will greet a user.

- `(name)`: name is the parameter. It's the placeholder for the value that will be passed into the function when it's called.
- `displayLn()`: function to print a greeting. Combines the string "Hello, " with the value stored in the name parameter.

- `greetUser("Lori");
greetUser("Elsa");`
    - These lines call the function and pass in different values for the name parameter.

    - First call prints "Hello, Lori", second prints "Hello, Elsa".

    - This shows how a single function can work with different inputs.

### Using Functions with Loops
### Example
Using the console let see an example of a function with two parameters **word** and **times** that will determine how many times a word will be printed depending on the arguments passed when the function is called.
In our example when the function is called the arguments **Javascript** and **3** are passed, so the function will print the word Javascript three times. 
```js
function repeatWord(word, times) {
  for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
    displayLn(word);
  }
}

repeatWord("JavaScript", 3);
```
### Exercise
- Create a function that takes a number and prints all numbers from 1 to that number.
```js
function countTo(num) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    displayLn(i);
  }
}

countTo(10);
```
### Exercise 
- Write a function called multiplyTable that prints the multiplication table of a given number.
```js
function multiplyTable(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    displayLn(n + " x " + i + " = " + (n * i));
  }
}

multiplyTable(4);
```
